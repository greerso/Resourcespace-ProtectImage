# Protect Image Plugin for ResourceSpace

This ResourceSpace plugin enhances the protection of image resources by:

1. Using ProtectImage.js to prevent right-click downloads of images.
2. Requiring JavaScript to be enabled for user sessions. If JavaScript is disabled, users are logged out to protect resources from being accessed without JavaScript-based protections.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your ResourceSpace `plugins` directory.
2. Rename the folder to `protect_image` if it's not already named that.
3. Go to the ResourceSpace admin interface, navigate to the plugins section, and enable the "Protect Image" plugin.
4. Test the plugin functionality on resource previews and thumbnails.

## Requirements

- ResourceSpace version 9.6 or later.
- JavaScript must be enabled in the user's browser for proper functionality.

## License

This plugin is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
